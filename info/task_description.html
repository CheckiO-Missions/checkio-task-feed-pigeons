    I start to feed one of the pigeons.
    A minute later two more fly by and a minute after that another 3.
    Then 4, and so on (Ex: 1+2+3+4+...). One portion of food lasts a pigeon for a minute,
    but in case there's not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons who arrived first ate first.
    Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without knowing when to stop.
    If I have <b class="code">N</b> portions of bird feed, how many pigeons will be fed with at least one portion of wheat?
